## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **"2019-2024 US Stock Market Data"** dataset. The project meticulously cleans, processes, visualizes, and derives insights from a diverse set of financial instruments, including major stock indices, technology giants, cryptocurrencies, precious metals, and energy commodities. The analysis explores key market dynamics such as price trends, volatility, and inter-asset correlations over a dynamic five-year period, culminating in a detailed report and a proposal for future time-series forecasting models.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 and `pip` installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

### Running the Analysis

1.  Place the raw dataset `Stock Market Dataset.csv` in the root directory of the project.

2.  Launch the Jupyter Notebook environment:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3.  Open the `Pratham_Agrawal_DS_CA1.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially from top to bottom. The notebook will perform all data cleaning, generate all 16 visualizations, and save the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_stock_market_data.csv`.
